# Core Location accuracy tester app for iOS

This demo app tests Core Location accuracy. It allows to change 'Accuracy', 'Distance Filter' and 'Activity Type' parameters of Location Manager and see how it affects accuracy of detected location.

I created this app in order to understand the accuracy of location detection on different devices. It also allows to check, for example, how turning WiFi on and off affects the accuracy (and it does).
